Part 0: Notice of Classification and Intent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.1. License Classification.
    This document constitutes a "Source-Available License with Social Use
    Restrictions." It is intentionally drafted to be incompatible with the
    definitions of "Open Source" as provided by the Open Source Initiative
    (OSI) and "Free Software" as provided by the Free Software Foundation
    (FSF). This distinction is fundamental to the License's purpose and
    should not be obscured.

0.2. Declaration of Primary Goal.
    The primary and overriding goal of this License is to establish and
    protect a digital commons. It seeks to ensure that technology created
    for social inclusion, empowerment, and accessibility remains perpetually
    available for those purposes. It achieves this by explicitly restricting
    direct commercial exploitation, particularly through scalable service
    models like Software as a Service (SaaS), which could otherwise transform
    the Work into a tool of economic exclusion. By using, modifying, or
    distributing this Work, You irrevocably agree to uphold these principles
    and adhere to the following restrictions.

Preamble: The Philosophy of the Social Commons

The vyAI Social Commons License (vSCL) is born from a simple yet resolute
conviction: technology designed to empower and include must never become a
barrier. This license governs software and other copyrightable works created
to serve communities, advance public education and research, support non-profit
organizations, and assist persons with disabilities. Its purpose is to carve
out a protected space—a digital commons—where essential tools remain freely
accessible for all socially beneficial applications.

This License grants broad permissions to use, study, modify, and share the Work.
It explicitly encourages the integration of the Work into physical hardware
products, recognizing that tangible innovation is a powerful means of delivering
technology to people's hands.

However, the License establishes a crucial ethical and legal boundary: the Work
itself cannot be sold or offered as a commercial service where access is
contingent on payment. This restriction is not intended to stifle all
commercial activity, but to ensure that any commercial activity centers around
physical delivery, human expertise, or ancillary support, rather than monetizing
access to the Work's core functionality itself.

For instance, a sophisticated AI-powered assistive reading system governed by
this License can be freely developed and deployed by public libraries,
rehabilitation centers, or NGOs serving communities with low digital literacy.
This License contractually protects this system from being appropriated by a
corporation that would rebrand it and charge a prohibitive monthly subscription
fee for the exact same service.

We believe that true innovation is measured by its service to humanity. This
License is our legal and philosophical commitment to that ideal, ensuring that
the fruits of our labor nurture social good, not just commercial profit. The
following terms and conditions are designed to enforce this philosophy with
maximum legal clarity and strength.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part I: Definitions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1. "This License" refers to the vyAI Social Commons License, Version 1.2
     (Definitive Edition).

1.2. "The Licensor" refers to the original copyright holder or the legal entity
     authorized by the copyright holder that is placing the Work under this
     License.

1.3. "The Work" refers to any copyrightable material—including but not limited
     to software in Source Code or Object Code form, documentation, datasets,
     specifications, and machine learning models (including weights and
     architecture)—that the Licensor has explicitly designated as being
     governed by this License.

1.4. "You" (or "Your") refers to an individual or a legal entity exercising
     the permissions granted by this License.

1.5. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Work for making
     modifications. This includes all modules, associated interface
     definition files, scripts controlling compilation and installation, and
     any other documentation necessary to understand, modify, and reproduce the
     Work.

1.6. "To Modify" means to create a "Derivative Work" by copying from or
     adapting all or part of the Work in a manner requiring copyright
     permission.

1.7. "Derivative Work" means any work based on or derived from the Work. This
     includes translations, adaptations, and any other form in which the Work
     may be recast or transformed. For the purposes of this License, a
     Derivative Work also includes any other work that integrates with the
     Work so intimately—whether through static linking, dynamic linking, or
     tight API coupling—that it cannot reasonably be considered an independent
     work.

1.8. "To Propagate" and "To Convey" have the same meaning as in the GNU
     General Public License version 3. To "Propagate" is to do anything that
     would make You liable for copyright infringement without permission,
     except for private modification or execution. To "Convey" is any
     propagation that enables others to receive copies.

1.9. "Permitted Social Purpose" refers to any use of the Work that is not a
     Prohibited Commercial Offering and is conducted by or for:
     a) Non-Profit and Charitable Organizations: Use by or for legally
        registered non-profit, charitable, or public-benefit organizations
        (e.g., a foundation providing digital literacy tools).
     b) Educational Use: Non-commercial activities within academic
        institutions (schools, universities) for teaching, learning, and
        academic research (e.g., a university computer science course using
        the Work as a case study).
     c) Public Research: Research by individuals or institutions where all
        results, data, and conclusions are made publicly available under terms
        that do not restrict access.
     d) Personal, Hobbyist, and Community Projects: Use by individuals or
        informal community groups for projects not intended for commercial
        gain or to support a commercial enterprise (e.g., a group of
        volunteers building a local community information kiosk).
     e) Accessibility Projects: The development and deployment of tools or
        services specifically intended to assist persons with disabilities,
        provided these tools themselves are not offered as a Prohibited
        Commercial Offering.

1.10. "Prohibited Commercial Offering" means making the core functionality of
      the Work, or a Derivative Work, available to third parties in a way that
      generates revenue by charging for access to the Work's features. This
      prohibition applies regardless of the delivery mechanism and includes,
      but is not limited to:
     a) Software as a Service (SaaS): Hosting the Work and charging users a
        fee for access, particularly when such access is monetized in a way
        that effectively denies individuals or communities equitable access to
        the Work. This clause shall be interpreted broadly, focusing on the
        effect of the offering on user access, not merely its technical
        implementation.
     b) Platform as a Service (PaaS): Providing a development or deployment
        platform that incorporates the Work as a core, monetized component that
        other developers build upon for a fee.
     c) API as a Service: Charging a fee for programmatic access to the Work's
        functionality via an Application Programming Interface (API).
     d) Direct Sale or Licensing: Selling, renting, leasing, or sublicensing
        the Work or a Derivative Work as a standalone software product.

1.11. "Permitted Hardware Product" refers to a tangible, physical hardware
      device that is sold to an end-user and which incorporates the Work. For a
      product to qualify, it must meet all of the following conditions:
     a) Substantial Independent Value: The hardware itself must possess
        substantial functionality, value, and complexity independent of the
        Work. The Work must not be the sole or primary element of value.
        (e.g., A consumer robot where the Work manages one of its sensor
        arrays, but the product's primary value lies in its mechanical
        construction, motors, battery system, and other onboard software).
     b) Integrated Feature: The Work must function as an integrated and
        supporting component, not as the primary marketed feature.
     c) Hardware-Centric Transaction: The marketing, sale, and pricing of the
        product must be clearly centered on the physical device. The cost to
        the end-user must not be framed or itemized as a license fee for the
        Work.

1.12. "Ancillary Services" refers to professional services based on human
      expertise, for which You may charge a fee. This includes providing
      installation, technical support, training, or consulting related to the
      Work. Offering Ancillary Services does not violate this License,
      provided the service does not function as a proxy for a Prohibited
      Commercial Offering.
