    <h2>Part 0: Notice of Classification and Intent</h2>
    <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
        <p><b>0.1. License Classification.</b> This document constitutes a "Source-Available
        License with Social Use Restrictions." It is intentionally drafted to be
        incompatible with the definitions of "Open Source" as provided by the Open
        Source Initiative (OSI) and "Free Software" as provided by the Free Software
        Foundation (FSF). This distinction is fundamental to the License's purpose
        and should not be obscured.</p>
        <p><b>0.2. Declaration of Primary Goal.</b> The primary and overriding goal of this
        License is to establish and protect a digital commons. It seeks to ensure
        that technology created for social inclusion, empowerment, and accessibility
        remains perpetually available for those purposes. It achieves this by
        explicitly restricting direct commercial exploitation, particularly through
        scalable service models like Software as a Service (SaaS), which could
        otherwise transform the Work into a tool of economic exclusion. By using,
        modifying, or distributing this Work, You irrevocably agree to uphold these
        principles and adhere to the following restrictions.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Preamble: The Philosophy of the Social Commons</h2>
    <p>The vyAI Social Commons License (vSCL) is born from a simple yet resolute
    conviction: technology designed to empower and include must never become a
    barrier. This license governs software and other copyrightable works created
    to serve communities, advance public education and research, support non-profit
    organizations, and assist persons with disabilities. Its purpose is to carve
    out a protected space—a digital commons—where essential tools remain freely
    accessible for all socially beneficial applications.</p>
    <p>This License grants broad permissions to use, study, modify, and share the
    Work. It explicitly encourages the integration of the Work into physical
    hardware products, recognizing that tangible innovation is a powerful means
    of delivering technology to people's hands.</p>
    <p>However, the License establishes a crucial ethical and legal boundary: the
    Work itself cannot be sold or offered as a commercial service where access is
    contingent on payment. This restriction is not intended to stifle all
    commercial activity, but to ensure that any commercial activity centers
    around physical delivery, human expertise, or ancillary support, rather than
    monetizing access to the Work's core functionality itself.</p>
    <p>For instance, a sophisticated AI-powered assistive reading system governed by
    this License can be freely developed and deployed by public libraries,
    rehabilitation centers, or NGOs serving communities with low digital literacy.
    This License contractually protects this system from being appropriated by a
    corporation that would rebrand it and charge a prohibitive monthly
    subscription fee for the exact same service.</p>
    <p>We believe that true innovation is measured by its service to humanity. This
    License is our legal and philosophical commitment to that ideal, ensuring that
    the fruits of our labor nurture social good, not just commercial profit. The
    following terms and conditions are designed to enforce this philosophy with
    maximum legal clarity and strength.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Part I: Definitions</h2>
    <p>For the purposes of this License, the following terms shall have the meanings
    specified below. These definitions are integral to the interpretation of Your
    rights and obligations.</p>
    <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
        <p><b>1.1. "This License"</b> refers to the vyAI Social Commons License, Version 1.2
        (Definitive Edition).</p>
        <p><b>1.2. "The Licensor"</b> refers to the original copyright holder or the legal
        entity authorized by the copyright holder that is placing the Work under
        this License.</p>
        <p><b>1.3. "The Work"</b> refers to any copyrightable material—including but not
        limited to software in Source Code or Object Code form, documentation,
        datasets, specifications, and machine learning models (including weights
        and architecture)—that the Licensor has explicitly designated as being
        governed by this License.</p>
        <p><b>1.4. "You" (or "Your")</b> refers to an individual or a legal entity exercising
        the permissions granted by this License.</p>
        <p><b>1.5. "Source Code"</b> means the preferred form of the Work for making
        modifications. This includes all modules, associated interface definition
        files, scripts controlling compilation and installation, and any other
        documentation necessary to understand, modify, and reproduce the Work.</p>
        <p><b>1.6. "To Modify"</b> means to create a "Derivative Work" by copying from or
        adapting all or part of the Work in a manner requiring copyright
        permission.</p>
        <p><b>1.7. "Derivative Work"</b> means any work based on or derived from the Work.
        This includes translations, adaptations, and any other form in which the
        Work may be recast or transformed. For the purposes of this License, a
        Derivative Work also includes any other work that integrates with the Work
        so intimately—whether through static linking, dynamic linking, or tight API
        coupling—that it cannot reasonably be considered an independent work.</p>
        <p><b>1.8. "To Propagate" and "To Convey"</b> have the same meaning as in the GNU
        General Public License version 3. To "Propagate" is to do anything that
        would make You liable for copyright infringement without permission, except
        for private modification or execution. To "Convey" is any propagation that
        enables others to receive copies.</p>
        <p><b>1.9. "Permitted Social Purpose"</b> refers to any use of the Work that is not a
        Prohibited Commercial Offering and is conducted by or for:</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <p>a) <b>Non-Profit and Charitable Organizations:</b> Use by or for legally
            registered non-profit, charitable, or public-benefit organizations (e.g.,
            a foundation providing digital literacy tools).</p>
            <p>b) <b>Educational Use:</b> Non-commercial activities within academic
            institutions (schools, universities) for teaching, learning, and academic
            research (e.g., a university computer science course using the Work as a
            case study).</p>
            <p>c) <b>Public Research:</b> Research by individuals or institutions where all
            results, data, and conclusions are made publicly available under terms
            that do not restrict access.</p>
            <p>d) <b>Personal, Hobbyist, and Community Projects:</b> Use by individuals or
            informal community groups for projects not intended for commercial gain
            or to support a commercial enterprise (e.g., a group of volunteers
            building a local community information kiosk).</p>
            <p>e) <b>Accessibility Projects:</b> The development and deployment of tools or
            services specifically intended to assist persons with disabilities,
            provided these tools themselves are not offered as a Prohibited
            Commercial Offering.</p>
        </div>
        <p><b>1.10. "Prohibited Commercial Offering"</b> means making the core functionality
        of the Work, or a Derivative Work, available to third parties in a way that
        generates revenue by charging for access to the Work's features. This
        prohibition applies regardless of the delivery mechanism and includes, but
        is not limited to:</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <p>a) <b>Software as a Service (SaaS):</b> Hosting the Work and charging users a
            fee for access, particularly when such access is monetized in a way that
            effectively denies individuals or communities equitable access to the Work.
            This clause shall be interpreted broadly, focusing on the effect of the
            offering on user access, not merely its technical implementation.</p>
            <p>b) <b>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</b> Providing a development or deployment
            platform that incorporates the Work as a core, monetized component that
            other developers build upon for a fee.</p>
            <p>c) <b>API as a Service:</b> Charging a fee for programmatic access to the Work's
            functionality via an Application Programming Interface (API).</p>
            <p>d) <b>Direct Sale or Licensing:</b> Selling, renting, leasing, or sublicensing
            the Work or a Derivative Work as a standalone software product.</p>
        </div>
        <p><b>1.11. "Permitted Hardware Product"</b> refers to a tangible, physical hardware
        device that is sold to an end-user and which incorporates the Work. For a
        product to qualify, it must meet all of the following conditions:</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <p>a) <b>Substantial Independent Value:</b> The hardware itself must possess
            substantial functionality, value, and complexity independent of the Work.
            The Work must not be the sole or primary element of value. (e.g., A
            consumer robot where the Work manages one of its sensor arrays, but the
            product's primary value lies in its mechanical construction, motors,
            battery system, and other onboard software).</p>
            <p>b) <b>Integrated Feature:</b> The Work must function as an integrated and
            supporting component, not as the primary marketed feature.</p>
            <p>c) <b>Hardware-Centric Transaction:</b> The marketing, sale, and pricing of the
            product must be clearly centered on the physical device. The cost to the
            end-user must not be framed or itemized as a license fee for the Work.</p>
        </div>
        <p><b>1.12. "Ancillary Services"</b> refers to professional services based on human
        expertise, for which You may charge a fee. This includes providing
        installation, technical support, training, or consulting related to the Work.
        Offering Ancillary Services does not violate this License, provided the
        service does not function as a proxy for a Prohibited Commercial Offering.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Part II: Core Permissions and Scope</h2>
    <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
        <p><b>2.1. Grant of License.</b> Subject to Your strict adherence to all terms and
        conditions of this License, the Licensor grants You a worldwide,
        royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration
        of the copyright) license to:</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <p>a) Use the Work for any Permitted Social Purpose.</p>
            <p>b) Use the Work for internal evaluation, research, and development within
            any organization, including for-profit corporations, provided such use
            does not result in a Prohibited Commercial Offering.</p>
            <p>c) Create and Modify the Work to produce Derivative Works.</p>
            <p>d) Reproduce and Convey verbatim copies of the Work's Source Code.</p>
            <p>e) Convey Derivative Works, but only under the conditions mandated in
            Part III.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Part III: Conditions on Distribution (Social Commons Copyleft)</h2>
    <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
        <p><b>3.1. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</b> You may Convey verbatim copies of the Work’s
        Source Code as You receive it, in any medium, provided that You conspicuously
        and appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice; maintain
        all notices referring to this License and to the disclaimer of warranty; and
        provide a full copy of this License to all recipients.</p>
        <p><b>3.2. Conveying Derivative Works.</b> You may Convey a Derivative Work, but only
        under the following mandatory conditions:</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <p>a) You must fulfill all obligations listed in Section 3.1.</p>
            <p>b) The Derivative Work must carry prominent notices stating that You
            modified it, with a relevant date.</p>
            <p>c) The Derivative Work as a whole must be licensed under this License.
            You must ensure that anyone who comes into possession of a copy receives
            a license to the entire work under these same terms. This obligation is
            absolute and applies to all parts of the Derivative Work, regardless of
            how they are packaged.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Part IV: Restrictions and Exemptions</h2>
    <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
        <p><b>4.1. Absolute Prohibition on Commercial Offerings.</b> To be unmistakably clear:
        You may not, under any circumstance, use the Work or any Derivative Work, in
        whole or in part, to create, support, or offer a Prohibited Commercial
        Offering as defined in Section 1.10. This is the central, non-negotiable
        restriction of this License.</p>
        <p><b>4.2. Guiding Principle for Interpretation.</b> In any case of ambiguity regarding
        whether a specific use case constitutes a Prohibited Commercial Offering, the
        interpretation that best serves the License's stated goal of protecting the
        Work for the digital commons and preventing its transformation into a tool of
        economic exclusion shall prevail.</p>
        <p><b>4.3. Explicitly Permitted Commercial Activities.</b> Notwithstanding the
        prohibition in Section 4.1, the following are not considered violations:</p>
        <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
            <p>a) Sale of Permitted Hardware Products: You may manufacture and sell
            Permitted Hardware Products as defined in Section 1.11.</p>
            <p>b) Provision of Ancillary Services: You may charge fees for providing
            Ancillary Services as defined in Section 1.12.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Part V: Standard Legal Provisions</h2>
    <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
        <p><b>5.1. Termination.</b> Your rights under this License terminate automatically and
        immediately if You fail to comply with any of its terms. If You cease all
        violations, Your license is reinstated provisionally unless and until the
        Licensor explicitly terminates it, and permanently if the Licensor fails to
        notify You of the violation within 60 days of Your cessation.</p>
        <p><b>5.2. Acceptance.</b> You are not required to accept this License to receive or
        run a copy of the Work. However, nothing else grants You permission to
        Propagate or Modify it. By undertaking these actions, You indicate Your
        unconditional acceptance of all terms and conditions herein.</p>
        <p><b>5.3. NO WARRANTY.</b> THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
        KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.</p>
        <p><b>5.4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b> IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR
        ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
        TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR
        THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.</p>
        <p><b>5.5. Severability and Interpretation.</b> If any provision of this License is
        held to be unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the minimum extent
        necessary to make it enforceable. The Preamble, Notices, and Definitions are
        integral parts of this License and must be used in its interpretation.</p>

    <h2>APPENDIX A: Practical Examples and Scenarios</h2>
    <p><em>This appendix is for informational purposes and does not replace the legally
    binding terms above.</em></p>
    <div style="padding-left: 3em;">
        <p><b>Scenario 1: The Non-Profit Foundation (Permitted)</b><br>
        <b>Action:</b> A foundation for digital inclusion downloads the Work, modifies
        it to better suit local languages, and deploys it on free-to-use
        terminals in community centers.<br>
        <b>Verdict:</b> Permitted. This is a clear example of a "Permitted Social Purpose."</p>

        <p><b>Scenario 2: The Hardware Startup (Permitted)</b><br>
        <b>Action:</b> A startup designs and builds an advanced robotic arm for use in
        physical therapy. The Work is used to control the arm's fine motor
        movements. They sell the robotic arm for $5,000.<br>
        <b>Verdict:</b> Permitted. This is a "Permitted Hardware Product." The value is
        in the hardware, and the Work is an integrated component.</p>

        <p><b>Scenario 3: The SaaS Company (Prohibited)</b><br>
        <b>Action:</b> A tech company takes the Work, hosts it on its cloud servers,
        and sells API access to other developers at $0.01 per call.<br>
        <b>Verdict:</b> Prohibited. This is a textbook "Prohibited Commercial Offering"
        (SaaS/API as a Service) and a direct violation of Section 4.1.</p>

        <p><b>Scenario 4: The IT Consulting Firm (Permitted)</b><br>
        <b>Action:</b> A consulting firm charges a corporate client $10,000 to install,
        configure, and integrate the Work into the client's internal document
        management system. The client does not offer this system to external
        users as a service.<br>
        <b>Verdict:</b> Permitted. The consulting firm is selling "Ancillary Services"
        (human expertise). The client is using the work for "Internal Business Use."
        Neither is a violation.</p>

        <p><b>Scenario 5: The "Freemium Wrapper" (Prohibited)</b><br>
        <b>Action:</b> A company offers a "free" online service that is a thin wrapper
        around the Work's functionality. However, to unlock essential features
        (like saving files or handling larger inputs), users must upgrade to a "Pro"
        plan for $15/month.<br>
        <b>Verdict:</b> Prohibited. This is an attempt to circumvent the SaaS
        restriction. The service's core value is derived from the Work, and its
        access is monetized. This violates the spirit and letter of the License.</p>
    </div>
