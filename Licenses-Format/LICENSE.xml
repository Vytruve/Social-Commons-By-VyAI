        <title>License Classification</title>
        <text>License Classification. This document constitutes a "Source-Available License with Social Use Restrictions." It is intentionally drafted to be incompatible with the definitions of "Open Source" as provided by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and "Free Software" as provided by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). This distinction is fundamental to the License's purpose and should not be obscured.</text>

        <title>Declaration of Primary Goal</title>
        <text>Declaration of Primary Goal. The primary and overriding goal of this License is to establish and protect a digital commons. It seeks to ensure that technology created for social inclusion, empowerment, and accessibility remains perpetually available for those purposes. It achieves this by explicitly restricting direct commercial exploitation, particularly through scalable service models like Software as a Service (SaaS), which could otherwise transform the Work into a tool of economic exclusion. By using, modifying, or distributing this Work, You irrevocably agree to uphold these principles and adhere to the following restrictions.</text>

  <preamble><![CDATA[
The vyAI Social Commons License (vSCL) is born from a simple yet resolute conviction: technology designed to empower and include must never become a barrier. This license governs software and other copyrightable works created to serve communities, advance public education and research, support non-profit organizations, and assist persons with disabilities. Its purpose is to carve out a protected space—a digital commons—where essential tools remain freely accessible for all socially beneficial applications.

This License grants broad permissions to use, study, modify, and share the Work. It explicitly encourages the integration of the Work into physical hardware products, recognizing that tangible innovation is a powerful means of delivering technology to people's hands.

However, the License establishes a crucial ethical and legal boundary: the Work itself cannot be sold or offered as a commercial service where access is contingent on payment. This restriction is not intended to stifle all commercial activity, but to ensure that any commercial activity centers around physical delivery, human expertise, or ancillary support, rather than monetizing access to the Work's core functionality itself.

For instance, a sophisticated AI-powered assistive reading system governed by this License can be freely developed and deployed by public libraries, rehabilitation centers, or NGOs serving communities with low digital literacy. This License contractually protects this system from being appropriated by a corporation that would rebrand it and charge a prohibitive monthly subscription fee for the exact same service.

We believe that true innovation is measured by its service to humanity. This License is our legal and philosophical commitment to that ideal, ensuring that the fruits of our labor nurture social good, not just commercial profit. The following terms and conditions are designed to enforce this philosophy with maximum legal clarity and strength.

    <title>Part I: Definitions</title>
    <subsection id="1.1"><title>This License</title><text>"This License" refers to the vyAI Social Commons License, Version 1.2 (Definitive Edition).</text></subsection>
    <subsection id="1.2"><title>The Licensor</title><text>"The Licensor" refers to the original copyright holder or the legal entity authorized by the copyright holder that is placing the Work under this License.</text></subsection>
    <subsection id="1.3"><title>The Work</title><text>"The Work" refers to any copyrightable material—including but not limited to software in Source Code or Object Code form, documentation, datasets, specifications, and machine learning models (including weights and architecture)—that the Licensor has explicitly designated as being governed by this License.</text></subsection>
    <subsection id="1.4"><title>You</title><text>"You" (or "Your") refers to an individual or a legal entity exercising the permissions granted by this License.</text></subsection>
    <subsection id="1.5"><title>Source Code</title><text>"Source Code" means the preferred form of the Work for making modifications. This includes all modules, associated interface definition files, scripts controlling compilation and installation, and any other documentation necessary to understand, modify, and reproduce the Work.</text></subsection>
    <subsection id="1.6"><title>To Modify</title><text>"To Modify" means to create a "Derivative Work" by copying from or adapting all or part of the Work in a manner requiring copyright permission.</text></subsection>
    <subsection id="1.7"><title>Derivative Work</title><text>"Derivative Work" means any work based on or derived from the Work. This includes translations, adaptations, and any other form in which the Work may be recast or transformed. For the purposes of this License, a Derivative Work also includes any other work that integrates with the Work so intimately—whether through static linking, dynamic linking, or tight API coupling—that it cannot reasonably be considered an independent work.</text></subsection>
    <subsection id="1.8"><title>To Propagate and To Convey</title><text>"To Propagate" and "To Convey" have the same meaning as in the GNU General Public License version 3. To "Propagate" is to do anything that would make You liable for copyright infringement without permission, except for private modification or execution. To "Convey" is any propagation that enables others to receive copies.</text></subsection>
    <subsection id="1.9"><title>Permitted Social Purpose</title><text>"Permitted Social Purpose" refers to any use of the Work that is not a Prohibited Commercial Offering and is conducted by or for:
* a) Non-Profit and Charitable Organizations: Use by or for legally registered non-profit, charitable, or public-benefit organizations (e.g., a foundation providing digital literacy tools).
* b) Educational Use: Non-commercial activities within academic institutions (schools, universities) for teaching, learning, and academic research (e.g., a university computer science course using the Work as a case study).
* c) Public Research: Research by individuals or institutions where all results, data, and conclusions are made publicly available under terms that do not restrict access.
* d) Personal, Hobbyist, and Community Projects: Use by individuals or informal community groups for projects not intended for commercial gain or to support a commercial enterprise (e.g., a group of volunteers building a local community information kiosk).
* e) Accessibility Projects: The development and deployment of tools or services specifically intended to assist persons with disabilities, provided these tools themselves are not offered as a Prohibited Commercial Offering.</text></subsection>
    <subsection id="1.10"><title>Prohibited Commercial Offering</title><text>"Prohibited Commercial Offering" means making the core functionality of the Work, or a Derivative Work, available to third parties in a way that generates revenue by charging for access to the Work's features. This prohibition applies regardless of the delivery mechanism and includes, but is not limited to:
* a) Software as a Service (SaaS): Hosting the Work and charging users a fee for access, particularly when such access is monetized in a way that effectively denies individuals or communities equitable access to the Work. This clause shall be interpreted broadly, focusing on the effect of the offering on user access, not merely its technical implementation.
* b) Platform as a Service (PaaS): Providing a development or deployment platform that incorporates the Work as a core, monetized component that other developers build upon for a fee.
* c) API as a Service: Charging a fee for programmatic access to the Work's functionality via an Application Programming Interface (API).
* d) Direct Sale or Licensing: Selling, renting, leasing, or sublicensing the Work or a Derivative Work as a standalone software product.</text></subsection>
